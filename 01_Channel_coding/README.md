# Channel coding assignments

Different encoders can be found in this repository:

- Repetition Code
- Parity Code
- Hamming Code (Generic)

In order to test the different classes developed, different scenarios have been indicated, where each encoder is used to transmit a binary message through a noisy channel (Simulated with the Channel class).

Additionally, a scenario has been made where the Hamming encoder (7,4) is tested with a plain text so that the effect of recovery to channel-induced random errors can be seen better. The results can be seen at [``data.txt``](data/data.txt) and [``data_out.txt``](data/data_out.txt)
